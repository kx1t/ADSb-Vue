# ADSb-Vue

A standalone **3D volumetric view of your ADS-B antenna reception**, driven by an
Ultrafeeder / tar1090 receiver. Inspired by the "detection cone" viewer, but with
switchable render modes and a true volumetric density render.

It reads tar1090's rolling recent-history chunks (`/chunks/chunks.json` +
`chunk_*.gz`), converts every aircraft observation to bearing / distance /
altitude relative to the receiver, and serves a self-contained Three.js page.

> For a more in-depth description of how the Python server and the Three.js
> frontend actually work, see **[DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md)**.

## Render modes (toggle in the UI)

- **Density volume** — observations binned into 3D cells drawn as translucent,
  colour-by-altitude blocks. Bright where reception is dense; you can see the
  low-altitude core near the receiver fade to high-altitude-only at the fringes.
- **Detection cone** — the *coverage floor*: the lowest altitude still heard at
  each bearing and range. ~0 near the receiver, rising with distance as the
  horizon hides low traffic. Dents = local blockage; the ragged rim = reach.
- **Point cloud** — every observation as an altitude-coloured point (the classic
  view; you can pick out individual airways).

Altitude-band checkboxes filter all three modes. The vertical axis is
exaggerated ~2× (45 kft ≈ 180 units vs 250 nm ≈ 250 units) so the naturally thin
altitude band reads as a dome rather than a pancake.

## Timeline — coverage over time

The **Timeline** panel replays how your coverage built up over the retained
history window. Drag the scrubber to reveal only what was first heard up to a
given moment, or press ▶ to sweep the whole window — all three render modes
animate the coverage filling in. **Loop** repeats the sweep and the **speed**
button (0.5–4×) sets how fast it runs.

**⏺ Export** records a play-through to a WebM file for sharing. The clip has a
burned-in **date/time** stamp of the moment each frame represents, a progress bar,
and a slow camera orbit while recording. (Recording needs a Chromium- or
Firefox-based browser.)

How far back the window reaches is set by `ADSB_MAX_CHUNKS` — bigger is more
history (`0` = everything the feeder retains). With **persistence** enabled
(`ADSB_DATA_DIR`, see below), the timeline instead spans the whole accumulated
store — up to `ADSB_RETAIN_DAYS` of coverage.

## Run

    python3 server.py

Zero third-party dependencies — Python 3 standard library only. Then open
`http://<this-host>:24556/`. (The page pulls Three.js + a US state outline from
public CDNs, so the *viewer's browser* needs internet; the server only talks to
your Ultrafeeder on the LAN.)

## Configuration

Everything is optional — on the same host as your feeder the defaults just work
(`ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER=http://127.0.0.1`, port `24556`). All settings are `ADSB_*`
environment variables:

| Var                | Default              | Meaning                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER` | `http://127.0.0.1`   | Base URL of your tar1090 instance (the ADS-B **data source** — any host/port) |
| `ADSB_WEB_PORT`    | `24556`              | Web-UI port to listen on (alias: `ADSB_PORT`). Not a data port. |
| `ADSB_RECV_LAT`    | auto                 | Receiver latitude (else `/data/receiver.json`) |
| `ADSB_RECV_LON`    | auto                 | Receiver longitude                        |
| `ADSB_MAX_CHUNKS`  | `48`                 | Newest-first chunk cap (0 = all history)  |
| `ADSB_CELL_NM`     | `1.5`                | De-dup grid cell size (nm)                |
| `ADSB_ALT_BIN_FT`  | `1000`               | De-dup altitude bin (ft)                  |
| `ADSB_MAX_RANGE_NM`| `400`                | Discard positions farther than this (nm)  |
| `ADSB_LOW_ALT_FT`  | `10000`              | "Low altitude" cutoff for the low-alt range stat (ft) |
| `ADSB_FETCH_WORKERS`| `8`                 | Parallel chunk downloads (1 = serial; higher helps a remote feeder) |
| `ADSB_CACHE_SECS`  | `120`                | Seconds to cache parsed observations      |
| `ADSB_ANTENNA_AGL_FT`| `30`               | Antenna height above ground (ft) for the terrain horizon model |
| `ADSB_BORDER_COLOR`| `#3f82b8`            | State border colour (hex)                 |
| `ADSB_HOME_BORDER_COLOR`| `#6fd6c0`       | Home-state border colour (hex)            |
| `ADSB_FOG_DENSITY` | `0.0012`             | Distance-fade density; `0` disables the fade |
| `ADSB_DATA_DIR`    | *(unset)*            | Volume dir for long-term persistence (see below). Unset = no store. |
| `ADSB_RETAIN_DAYS` | `30`                 | Store retention: drop cells not heard within N days (`0` = keep all) |
| `ADSB_HEYWHATSTHAT_ID` | *(unset)*        | Your HeyWhatsThat panorama id — enables the HWT range-rings overlay |
| `ADSB_HEYWHATSTHAT_ALTS_FT` | `10000,40000` | HWT ring altitudes (ft, comma-separated) |

Reading is coarse on purpose: this is a coverage map, not a traffic replay.
Raise `ADSB_MAX_CHUNKS` (e.g. `0`) for the fullest envelope at the cost of a
bigger payload and slower first load; lower `ADSB_CELL_NM` for finer detail.

### Setting them

**Docker — inline (simplest for a few settings).** Add an `environment:` block to
the `adsbvue` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  adsbvue:
    build: .
    image: adsbvue:latest
    container_name: adsbvue
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER=http://192.168.1.50
      - ADSB_MAX_CHUNKS=0
```

**Docker — `.env` file (tidier for many settings).** Copy `.env.example` to
`.env`, edit it, and point the service at it instead of an `environment:` block:

```yaml
services:
  adsbvue:
    build: .
    image: adsbvue:latest
    container_name: adsbvue
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
```

Keep `.env` comments on their own line (not after a value). If you use *both*,
`environment:` entries win over `env_file:`.

**Apply your changes.** After editing `docker-compose.yml` or `.env`, re-run it to
recreate the container with the new settings:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Add `--build` (`docker compose up -d --build`) whenever the **code** changed too —
e.g. after a `git pull` — so the image is rebuilt. It's always safe to include
`--build`.

**Without Docker.** Export the vars (`ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER=... python3 server.py`) or
drop a `.env` next to `server.py` — it auto-loads one. A real environment
variable always overrides the file. Restart the process to pick up changes.

## Customizing the map

State borders and lakes are drawn automatically and the home state(s) are
highlighted based on your receiver's position — no editing needed.

The labelled **cities** default to a short upper-Midwest US example. To use your
own, put a git-ignored `cities.local.json` where the app can see it (a JSON array
of `[ "label", lat, lon ]` entries — start from `cities.local.json.example`).
The server serves it at `/cities`; only entries within range of the receiver are
drawn; absent, the built-in defaults are used. Where it lives depends on how you
run:

- **With a `data/` volume (recommended — required for the prebuilt image):** the
  file lives at `data/cities.local.json`. Edit it and reload the page — no
  rebuild, and it survives updates and container recreation. See the persistence
  section below.
- **Building from source without a volume:** put it next to `server.py` before
  `docker compose up --build` (the Dockerfile bakes it into the image; rebuild
  after editing). Running plain `python3 server.py` reads it directly.

If your coverage spans several states, you can **group** the list to keep a long
file tidy — the group names are just for you (they're flattened for display):

```json
{
  "Minnesota": [ ["Minneapolis", 44.98, -93.27], ["Duluth", 46.78, -92.11] ],
  "Wisconsin": [ ["Madison", 43.07, -89.40], ["Green Bay", 44.51, -88.01] ]
}
```

Both the flat array and this grouped object are accepted.

## Terrain — predicted vs. measured coverage

Under **Terrain** in the panel, the viewer can compare what you *actually hear*
against what the surrounding terrain physically *lets* you hear. It's optional and
loads open elevation tiles in the browser on demand; if they can't be reached, the
rest of the app is unaffected. (There's also a **"? What am I seeing?"** button in
that section with the same explanation in-app.)

**▲ Predicted horizon** draws the lowest altitude an aircraft can fly and still be
in your antenna's line of sight, given the terrain around you and the earth's
curvature — a smooth bowl that's ~ground level at the receiver and rises with
distance. Set your mast height with `ADSB_ANTENNA_AGL_FT` (feet; the ground
elevation is read from the terrain automatically). A taller antenna sees over more
terrain and lowers the horizon.

**◑ Compare to horizon** recolours your measured detection cone by how it stacks
up against that horizon:

- **green** — you hear low traffic right down to the horizon: confirmed good coverage.
- **amber** — the lowest aircraft you heard sits higher than terrain says it should.
- **blue** — you heard something *below* the predicted horizon: over-performing.
- **grey** — only high traffic flew here, so low-altitude coverage can't be judged.

Two things to keep in mind when reading it:

- **Grey isn't bad.** You still have coverage there — you're hearing aircraft — but
  no *low* traffic came through to grade it, so low-altitude performance is simply
  *unknown*, not poor. The comparison only applies where the measured floor is below
  ~18,000 ft (i.e. low traffic actually flew there).
- **Amber is a clue, not a verdict.** It can mean a real gap (terrain or an obstruction
  blocking you), *or* just that the lowest plane that flew that way happened to be
  fairly high — which is why it's understated rather than alarm-red. Click a direction
  to open a **bearing profile** (terrain, horizon, and the actual hits along that
  bearing) to tell the two apart; green usually traces your busy arrival/departure
  corridors.

**◌ HWT range rings** — if you feed [HeyWhatsThat](https://www.heywhatsthat.com)
(most Ultrafeeder setups do; it's where tar1090's range rings come from), set
`ADSB_HEYWHATSTHAT_ID` to your panorama id and this toggle draws those same
trusted rings in 3D: each ring floats at its altitude and marks where a plane at
that altitude drops below your horizon. It's an independent model of the same
physics as the predicted horizon, so it doubles as a cross-check of both. The
server fetches the data once and caches it (on the `data/` volume when present),
so their free API is hit essentially never. Ring altitudes:
`ADSB_HEYWHATSTHAT_ALTS_FT` (default `10000,40000`). The panorama must be for
your receiver's location.

## Long-term coverage (persistence)

By default the viewer shows the feeder's rolling history (~a day) and resets on
container recreation. Set **`ADSB_DATA_DIR`** to a mapped volume and coverage
**accumulates there** across restarts, so you can build a weeks/months-long
envelope and the timeline sweeps the whole period. It's optional and off unless
you set it.

```yaml
services:
  adsbvue:
    # ...
    environment:
      - ADSB_DATA_DIR=/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

The `./data:/data` bind mount keeps everything the container accumulates in a
`data/` folder **inside this repo folder** (e.g. `/opt/adsbvue/data`) — the same
place you manage the container from, easy to find and back up. It's git-ignored,
so `git pull` never touches it.

**Why `cities.local.json` lives in `data/` too:** everything in the app folder is
replaced by updates (`git pull` + rebuild), and everything baked into the image
dies with the container. The `data/` volume is the one place that survives both —
so that's where *your* stuff belongs: the accumulated coverage **and** your city
labels. On first run the app seeds `data/cities.local.json` from your existing
copy; from then on you edit it there and just reload the page — **no rebuild
needed**, and it survives every update and container recreation. See
[docs/persistence.md](docs/persistence.md) for the design.

## Endpoints

- `GET /`        — the 3D viewer page
- `GET /cone`    — observations as JSON (`?refresh=true` bypasses the cache)
- `GET /cities`  — optional local city labels (your `cities.local.json`, else `[]`)
- `GET /hwt`     — cached HeyWhatsThat horizon rings (`{}` when no id is set)
- `GET /health`  — liveness

## Run via Docker (recommended)

Easiest on the same host that runs Ultrafeeder — co-located, always-on,
near-zero impact.

**Prebuilt image (no clone needed).** Every push to `main` is auto-built for
amd64 **and** arm64 (Raspberry Pi) and published to GitHub Container Registry.
Just point a compose file at it:

```yaml
services:
  adsbvue:
    image: ghcr.io/jrsphoto/adsbvue:latest
    container_name: adsbvue
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - ADSB_DATA_DIR=/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

Update with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. (With a prebuilt
image your `cities.local.json` lives on the `data/` volume — see the
persistence section above.)

**Build from source.** From a clone of this repo:

    docker compose up -d --build

Then open `http://<host>:24556/`. Host networking lets the container read
tar1090 at `127.0.0.1:80` and serve the viewer on the host's `:24556`.

**Somewhere else / remote feeder (bridge networking).** Drop host networking,
map a port, and point `ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER` at your tar1090 (a public HTTPS map URL
works too):

```yaml
services:
  adsbvue:
    build: .
    container_name: adsbvue
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER=https://your.tar1090.example/map
      - ADSB_MAX_CHUNKS=0
    ports:
      - 8077:24556          # host:container — the container's port is ADSB_WEB_PORT
```

**Behind a reverse proxy.** The page uses relative paths, so serving it under a
subpath works — just make sure the location has a **trailing slash** (e.g.
`location /adsbvue/ { proxy_pass http://adsbvue:24556/; }`) so `./cone` resolves
to `…/adsbvue/cone`.

**Updating:** pull the latest code and rebuild —

    git pull && docker compose up -d --build

## Run as a service

See `adsbvue.service` (a systemd **user** unit — adjust the path and
`ADSB_ULTRAFEEDER` inside it first):

    cp adsbvue.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now adsbvue
    loginctl enable-linger "$USER"   # keep it running across logout

It can run on any host that can reach your Ultrafeeder.

## Privacy

The viewer remembers your **display settings** — render mode, sliders, altitude
bands, timeline loop/speed, and map orientation — in the browser's local storage
so the page comes back the way you left it. It's purely functional and
first-party: the values are display preferences (not personal data), they never
leave your browser, and nothing is shared or used for tracking or analytics — so
there's no consent banner. Clear them anytime with **Reset saved settings** in the
panel (or your browser's site-data controls). The server itself stores no
per-visitor data. *(If you fork this and add analytics or any third-party
storage, that would need its own consent mechanism — this doesn't.)*
